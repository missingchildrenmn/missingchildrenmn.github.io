## **Prevention Education Resources**

Missing Children Minnesota is at the forefront of the battle to keep our children safe. As parents, professionals and educators, we believe that prevention is the crucial step we can take today that could play a large role in the safety of our children tomorrow. 

Our founder, Carol Watson, developed age-appropriate personal safety programs for children from preschool through adulthood, and wrote books based upon all three programs. We continue to present these programs at the request of host organizations across the state of Minnesota.

Each program deals with the issues facing children as they grow. 

Overviews of each program follow. 
Books may be purchased directly from Missing Children Minnesota, or ordered at any bookstore using the ISBN numbers.
