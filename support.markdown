## HOW TO SUPPORT MISSING CHILDREN MINNESOTA

Here are just a few ways to become involved!

### Volunteer

We always have projects and special needs that can be filled by volunteers. Whether you have a few hours every month or every week, there are many ways you can help. In addition, many companies offer paid time off for their employees to volunteer — check with your human resources or community relations department. *See current volunteer opportunities at the bottom of this page…

### Make a Gift

Missing Children Minnesota is a non-profit organization. As such, we are always in need of donations — both monetary and in-kind. Monetary gifts can be mailed to: 416 East Hennepin Avenue Suite # 217, Minneapolis, MN 55414

### Designate us in your workplace giving campaign

MCM is a member of Community Shares MN, the second-largest workplace giving campaign in the Twin Cities area. You can donate to us through Community Shares MN, or any other giving campaign, simply by designating Missing Children Minnesota as the recipient of your donation. In addition, please check to see if your company offers a matching gift program before you donate!

### Join Amazon Smile

Designate us as your charity of choice http://smile.amazon.com.  Amazon Smile will donate .5% of every dollar you spend with them to support our programs and services. We are already benefitting from many supporters through this program, and every little bit helps!

### Make an In-Kind Donation

In addition, MCM maintains a wish list of items that we need to help us continue in our mission. Please contact MCM to find out our current list of items we need. MCM accepts items in good, working condition. Please contact us before sending an in-kind donation so that we can thank you properly!

## Current Opportunities

Currently, MCM has these opportunities for volunteers available.

### Part Time Office Manager

Perfect for a retired individual or stay-at-home-mom with school age children!

We’re looking for someone who would be willing to donate 10-20 hours per week helping us answer phones, write correspondence, take care of mailing and complete general office administration tasks. Must be familiar with Macintosh or willing to learn! Hours are flexible.

### Archival Specialist

MCM celebrated its 20th Anniversary in 2004 and as an older organization, we have many old materials that need to be transferred into a searchable archive or file. Newsletters, press clippings and many other hard-copy materials are taking up space and need to be organized and purged. This project will take approximately 10-20 hours to complete (possibly less for a really organized individual!) and the hours are flexible. Must be comfortable sorting and filing.

### Library Clerk

MCM is designated as a special collection because of the extensive number of materials that we possess about missing children, personal safety and child abduction. Although these items are loosely organized, they have never been inventoried or categorized. This would be an excellent opportunity for a library science student or library professional. We estimate that the project would take between 5-10 hours.

### Scrapbookers

We have many photos and mementos of our work and our accomplishments that we would like to organize into scrapbooks that help tell our story. Some work has been started on this, and we would love to see these memories come out of the drawers and boxes and find a place where they can speak to our visitors!

### Other

We have many other smaller projects that can be fulfilled by volunteers! Please contact us to see how you can help!
