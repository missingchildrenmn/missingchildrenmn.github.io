## HOW TO SUPPORT MISSING CHILDREN MINNESOTA

Here are just a few ways to become involved!

### Volunteer

We always have projects and needs that can be filled by volunteers. Whether you have a few hours every month or every week, there are many ways you can help: 

* Organizers - Organize a fundraiser or educational event! There is a real gift to running an event that people enjoy and where people give generously or take the opportunity to come and learn how to make kids safer!
* Social Media Content Creators -Are you a graphic artist or simply gifted at creating attention-grabbing infographics, appealing educational pamphlets, TicToks that draw eyeballs, or Instagram posts that speak volumes? We would love to have you volunteer with us! We have Canva, and just need people with time and talent.
* Poster Partners - Do you like to walk around your neighborhood? Do you have a gift for talking to people? Are you reliable and detail-oriented? We would love to have you distribute posters and flyers in your area AND (just as important) take them down again when children are located!
* Educational Program Ambassadors and Presenters - Are you passionate about child safety education, and making community connections? We could use a few messengers to get the word out about our educational programs, and a few good people willing to get up and present! Training is provided. We will make sure you have what you need to do a great presentation!
* Mobile app developer - We have an app in development that needs some more talent to take it across the finish line!

Many companies offer paid time off for their employees to volunteer, or even donation matching — check with your human resources or community relations department to see how your employer may amplify your gifts of time or money.

### Give a Gift

Missing Children Minnesota is a non-profit organization. As such, we are always in need of donations — both monetary and in-kind. As an all-volunteer organization, we keep our overhead costs low and make the most of every dollar as we pursue our mission and work.

Gifts can be mailed to us at [our business address](/contact).

There are also a number of ways that you can donate online:

### Designate us in your workplace giving campaign

Missing Children Minnesota is available as an option for many workplace giving platforms. You can give from your workplace simply by designating Missing Children Minnesota as the recipient of your donation. In addition, please check to see if your company offers a matching gift program before you donate!

### Interact on social media
