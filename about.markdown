## The History of MCM

In the summer of 1983, a group of parents of missing children met in Minneapolis to offer mutual support and comfort.

In 1984 this group of parents incorporated as the Missing Kids Action Agency to provide should be a local resource for parents and families dealing with the issue of a missing child.

The name was changed to Missing Children Minnesota (MCM) in 1986.

Some highlights of our history of leadership, service, and collaboration:

•	1983, participated in the rewriting of Minnesota’s parental abduction statute; Minn. Stat. § 609.26. 
•	1990, two delegates from MCM served on Governor Rudy Perpich Governor’s Task Force on Missing Children
•	1991,due to the efforts of the Governor’s task Force, the legislature passed the Missing Children’s Act, which included the registration of sex offenders, flagging of school records, and additional rewriting of the parental kidnapping statute.

•	MCM has helped thousands of families and children across Minnesota and the Midwest by providing 24 hour support and referral services. 

•	Every year, MCM presents abduction prevention and personal safety programs to schools, Parent Teacher Organizations, daycare centers, early childhood and family education groups, churches, and children’s vacation camps. We hope that by providing children with the tools they need to be safer this year, we will have fewer missing children next year.

•	We were a charter member of AMECO (Association of Missing and Exploited Children’s Organizations) before that organization was dissolved, and members of MCM filled leadership and membership roles within that organization throughout its existence.

•	We were a member of Community Shares of Minnesota, and members of MCM filled volunteer and leadership roles in that organization until it was dissolved in 2022.

•	Currently, MCM is recognized as a member of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s Family Assistance Outreach Network (NCMEC:FAON), and our Executive Director has been engaged by this group as a speaker.

•	Our Executive Director is a Certified Victim Advocate and member of the National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA)
